# My List of Demands - Why the Air Force benefits package is unmatched

This website attempts to provide a consolidated location outlining the benefits package members serving on active duty in the United States Air Force will receive. The intent is to educate the public on how PHENOMENAL the benefits package is. It is arguably unmatched by any job in the civilian sector. Hopefully it will inspire individuals to consider the Air Force as a viable career option.

If you're interested in joining the Air Force, you can find your local Air Force recruiter using the online [find a recruiter](https://www.airforce.com/find-a-recruiter) tool.

# Origin of My List of Demands

During a presentation in the summer of 2023, the Commander of Air Force Recruiting Service mentioned something he read/heard from someone about “my list of demands.” It was essentially a list of the benefits the Air Force offers and the list potential applicants should ask their current/future employers for. If the employer can’t meet that list of demands, then maybe the potential applicant should stop being a potential applicant and actually apply to join the Air Force.

If anyone walked into a job interview asking for the benefits package offered to Air Force members, the hiring official would probably laugh. But, I think that highlights how great the opportunities are in the Air Force. While there are some employers that offer some of these, I’d argue there aren’t any employers offering a total pay/benefits package that rivals what the Air Force offers. This is especially true for an individual with no previous job experience or college education.
