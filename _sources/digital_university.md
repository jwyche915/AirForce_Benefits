# Digital University

Have you ever heard of [Digital University](https://digitalu.af.mil/)? “Digital University, a joint venture started between the US Air Force and Space Force and available to members of the DoD, provides anytime access to Silicon Valley accredited technology training.” Most of the courses on the website are tech related (e.g. software development, AI, cloud computing, cyber security, data science), but there is also a program management learning path. FYSA…Digital University offers a learning path for AWS Cloud Architect. The entry level AWS Cloud Architect makes $71/hr…$147,680/yr.

 

We may not always be able to get applicants the AFSC they ultimately want (e.g. unavailable, low ASVAB, SJC, etc.), but we can help them get into that line of work outside the Air Force by showing them how they can leverage the tools/resources provided to all Airmen/Guardians regardless of your AFSC.

 

In addition to the Digital University, there is also a program called Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses (VET TEC) https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/vettec-high-tech-program/. It can be used during SkillBridge or after separating.

 

So, now you have another item for your “list of demands.”

Access to Silicon Valley accredited technical training, free of charge for as long as I work for the company (can take as many courses offered by the company)
