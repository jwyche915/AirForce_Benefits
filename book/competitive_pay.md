# Competitive Pay

Our society pushes college as the "golden ticket" to success. And while getting a college degree is ONE path to "success", there are other viable options that are often overlooked. The Air Force being one of them. This section attempts to present a comparison of a college graduate to someone who chose to enlist in the Air Force. 

## Direct Compensation
We start the comparison by looking at the direct compensation (i.e. pay) a recent college graduate to someone who's been serving in the Air Force for 4 years. 

### Assumptions:
- Because civlian and military pay varies based on location, we'll based this comparison on someone living in Orlando, FL.
- The rank of the military member is Senior Airman (SrA). The average time for advancement to SrA is 3 years.
- Presented salaries are based on data pulled from sources in May 2024.

Single Airman
$66,870 – includes base pay, BAH, BAS
$82,500 – the equivalent civilian pay if the $66,870 were fully taxed and included comparable medical coverage

Airmen with Dependents (calculated as married with one child)
$73,962 – includes base pay, BAH, BAS
$92,500 – the equivalent civilian pay if the $73,962 were fully taxed and included comparable medical coverage
 
Entry Level Salaries for Jobs Needing a 4-year College Degree

Electrical Engineer in Orlando  - $85,929 (Zip Recruiter)

You can spend 4 years getting a college degree…and student loan debt…and end up making less than someone who joined the Air Force with zero college credits. Or you can join the Air Force, let Uncle Sugar pay for your college degree…AND make more money while doing so. I’m no genius….BUUUUUUUT, I’m pretty sure I know which choice is a better financial one.
